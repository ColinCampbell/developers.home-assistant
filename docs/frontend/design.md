We maintain a design portal at <https://design.home-assistant.io> that provides information about various frontend aspects such as:

* UI components that can be reused
* Dashboard cards in various configurations and states
* Easy way to compare components and cards between light and dark theme
* Notes about specific wording in Home Assistant

When new components or features are added to the frontend, those need be added in the design portal as well. This page in the design portal explains the details on how to do so: <https://design.home-assistant.io/#design.home-assistant.io/editing>

:::note
While the public portal is named "design", in the frontend repository it is referred to as "gallery". That is why the script to run the gallery locally in your development environment can be found at `gallery/script/develop_gallery` and the source code in `gallery/src`.
